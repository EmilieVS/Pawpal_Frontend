# 🐾 PawPal – Your Pet Sitting Platform

This project is a full-stack web application that connects pet owners with trusted sitters near them.
As I'm currently in (intensive) training program, this will be a side project for me to put into practice what I've learned so far.
It is also a way for me to continue exploring and learning React.
This is the frontend Repo. You can take a look at the backend repo with the link below.
